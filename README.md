# Data Engineering
Data Engineering is the act of collecting, translating, and validating data for analysis. In particular, data engineers build data warehouses to empower data-driven decisions. This self paced course equips me with all the skills that would allow me to embark ina career in MLOps. The course is taught by [Data Talks Club](https://datatalks.club/)
